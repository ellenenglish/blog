                    <h3>Nicknames<br></h3>
                    <p>Cornflowers are sometimes referred to by their nickname, "bachelor's button" due to an old practice when men wore a cornflower in a buttonhole of their suit. Cornflowers, or Bachelor Buttons, are also used as boutonnieres in weddings, often worn by the groom and his best man which is a more modern twist on this traditional symbol of love and devotion.
                    Called ‘Bluet’ in England and ‘Bluebonnet’ in Scotland, in North America Cornflowers are sometimes called Ragged Robin, or Ragged Sailor because of the shaggy petals.</p><br>
                    <h3>Historical Significance</h3><br>
                    <p>The cornflower is the national flower of Estonia, representing the Estonian political party, and a symbol for social liberalism with the Swedish National Party. The blue cornflower also plays a role in German history, thanks to Queen Luis of Prussia who purportedly hid her children in a field of cornflowers when she fled Berlin.
                    The story is told that she kept them quiet by weaving wreaths made from the flowers. To honor her courage and resourcefulness, the Cornflower blue was adopted for the uniforms of the Prussian army. <span class = "blue">In France, the cornflower is a common symbol for veterans of World War to wear, as a reminder of the 1918 Armistice.</span></p></div>
